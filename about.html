            <h2>Why ZenDoodle?</h2>
            <p>ZenDoodle Studios is a family business, created by a team of sisters who found that <strong>"Mother"-ing and "Aunt"-ing became way more fun with art.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">It started the way most real family ideas start: at home, with our kids. We noticed how calm and happy they became when they had art in front of them. Colouring gave them a gentle way to focus, unwind, and express themselves. It brought us together too: more shared moments at the table, more conversation, more laughter, and a softer pace.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">That’s the heart of ZenDoodle. We create keepsakes that help people slow down, feel seen, and enjoy life in a constructive, peaceful way. Today, we design and print custom colouring books, activity and story books, and personalised art gifts for children, teens, and adults—made with care, sisterhood, and a whole lot of heart.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="color: var(--zen-teal); font-weight: bold;">Thank you for supporting our family business! <3</p>
